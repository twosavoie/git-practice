Branch make-branch
This is a practice for git and Github.
This is for git branch experiment-with-branches
This is me trying to experiment with cloning.
So this branch is different than the master. I thought I was on this branch and I made some changes. But I must have been on the master branch because this on had the fewer lines.  I tried to switch it back and it didn't work. So now I'm making changes to this branch and see what happens.
