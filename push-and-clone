This is a practice for git and Github.
This is for git branch experiment-with-branches
This is me trying to experiment with cloning.
This is NOT on the make-branch branch. I don't know yet how I'm supposed to know, besides the terminal, which branch I'm on. I also don't know how to access the unaffected master branch. Still working on this.
