Branch make-branch
This is a practice for git and Github.
This is for git branch experiment-with-branches
This is me trying to experiment with cloning.
So this branch is different than the master. I thought I was on this branch and I made some changes. But I must have been on the master branch because this on had the fewer lines.  I tried to switch it back and it didn't work. So now I'm making changes to this branch and see what happens.

Ok, so now I've made this branch and become more comfortable switching between it and master.

I've also discovered, at least with git add . that I must add and commit each branch. That's interesting. I wonder if git add -A is different. Another time...
